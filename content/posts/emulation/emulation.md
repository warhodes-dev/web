This is going to be a multi part series where I detail the process of creating a [Chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator from scratch. This guide will be targetted towards intermediate programmers (or ambitious beginners) who are interested in the principles of emulation and want to get their feet wet with an emulator project.

I've done this project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) with a [SLD2](https://www.libsdl.org/) renderer, but you can use any language or graphics library of your choosing. Be aware, however, that some of the concepts or libraries featured may be different from what you'll be using in Python, Go, C++, etc. Feel free to leave a comment for future readers if you spot one of these differences.
