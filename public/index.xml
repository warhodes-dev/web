      <description>This is going to be a multi part series where I detail the process of creating a Chip8 emulator from scratch. This guide will be targetted towards intermediate programmers (or ambitious beginners) who are interested in the principles of emulation and want to get their feet wet with an emulator project.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done this project in Rust with a SLD2 renderer, but you can use any language or graphics library of your choosing.</description>

      <description>My instinct tells me that if I want to learn the web, I better make my site completely from scratch in order to maximize my exposure to as many technical details as possible. However, this turns out to be a pretty bad strategy if my goal is an actual working website, I tend to get bored and quit after going 50 wikipedia layers deep into the history of ECMAScript or something.</description>
